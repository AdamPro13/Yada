# Yada

## Overview

Yada: “yet another drawing app” :).

## Requirements

### Basics

The final app should include **all** of the following:

* When the app opens, users should be presented with a large, blank canvas
* Users should be able to draw lines on the canvas by dragging a finger across the screen
* The app should provide visual feedback (draw the lines) in real time as the user draws
* Users should be able to undo the line drawn by the most recent gesture

### Next Steps

In addition to the points above, **choose at least one** of the following as an additional feature:

* Allow users to change the size and color of each line before drawing
* Add the ability to save, load and subsequently edit drawings (i.e. using NSCoding or Core Data)
* Add a way to share drawings to the camera roll and other destinations like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. as images (i.e. using UIActivityViewController)
* Find and implement a curve fitting algorithm to use when rendering the drawings

## Tips

When implementing your solution, please focus on the following:

1. Think carefully about the classes you write and make sure their responsibilities and relationships are clear
2. Make sure your project follows common Objective-C/iOS design patterns and conventions (MVC, delegation, etc.)
3. Rely on frameworks and third party libraries as needed

## Citing Sources

You are allowed to use whatever research materials or third party resources you feel are necessary to implement your solution. Please make sure all external code and resources are clearly cited--you may use functions or other blocks of code found on the Internet (i.e. on Stack Overflow or GitHub) as long as you include a link to the source in a comment. For example:

## Good luck!
